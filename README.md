# Topic-Modelling-Amazon-Fine-Food-Reviews

We encounter such huge texts of documents time and again. But, before reading the documents, if we can get an overview of what the documents are about, it would make the job so much easy. For example, before watching a movie, if we can watch its trailer, it can help us decide if the movie is worth it. Similarly, we can decide if the documents are worth the effort?

Or, alternatively, if we have a bunch of documents and we can identify each document with their "topic", we can shortlist the documents based on topic of interest - without having to read through all the documents.

In Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, Topic Models, a type of statistical model, gives us the ability to discover topics from a collection of documents.

# DATA

For the project, I used publicly available Amazon's Fine Food reveiws data. It can be accessed [here](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-FineFoods.html). The data contains approx. 569,000 reviews from 256,000 users.
