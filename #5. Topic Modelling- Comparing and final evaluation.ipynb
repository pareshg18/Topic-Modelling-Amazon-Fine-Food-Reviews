My husband installed it for me quickly and easily. It came with screws and it is wonderful. It iss easy to pull down to choose the K-cup I or my guests want, and just as easily, is pushed up again under my cabinet. I highly recommend this dispenser for anyone who wants more counter space or even just wants to have the most innovative design available.\n",

      "I received the Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink in Fruit Punch through Amazon Vine. Thankfully, I did not pay for it. My first bad experience with the \"Lift n' Pull\" safety tab that would not budge. After taking scissors to it, I finally got it open without making too much of a mess. There does not seem to be any harmful ingredients, and no calories, carbs, sodium, etc. But there is \"natural caffeine\" and vitamins. With so many chemical ingredients listed, I doubt the \"natural\" part of it. With a short squeeze it only diluted the water and barely had a taste, so I sqeezed a bit more in. It tastes a bit like a citrusy-fruit punch. Not too bad. But then the after taste hit me, and I can not get the nasty sickly-sweet taste out of my mouth. I think I will stick with the sugar-free drink mixes from Crystal Light. They taste better. And I had rather stay away from the caffeine.\n",

      "We regularly have different Dorset Cereals for breakfast and can thoroughly recommend the brand. They make really top-quality muesli and cereals which achieve the difficult trick of being tasty and nutritious. The levels of added sugars and salt are kept to a minimum; Dorset Cereals tend to get their flavour by including high proportions of fruit, nuts and seeds.(A word of caution, however! This does mean that they contain a reasonable level of fats and sugars, but in natural forms rather than processed artificial types. So the calorie count can be quite high, if you are watching your weight BUT this is offset by the low glycaemic impact of the food. Dorset Cereals tend to take quite a while to digest, can be very filling, and leave you feeling satisfied for a long time. You just need to watch the portion size...)This variety is a really tasty one; I adore the more fruity flavours and you can really taste the cranberries and cherries even though there is only a small amount of them in the recipe. The flame raisins are in a lot of Dorset Cereals and add to the overall chewyness and the different types of flakes mean that each spoonful is interestingly varied.This cereal is around 7% fiber, 10% protein and 63% carbohydrate overall. It is naturally quite juicy - unlike some mueslis which can be really dry and dusty - and the fruit makes it very tasty, so you do not get bored by the end of the box.One of our favourite flavours.9/10\n",
